## Install steps

1. Tap **Download APK**.
2. Open the downloaded file (usually in **Downloads**).
3. If prompted, allow installs from **{{BROWSER}}**:

   `Settings → Security/Privacy → Install unknown apps → {{BROWSER}} → Allow`

4. Tap **Install**.

## Updates

Dumb.Co will occasionally check for updates. When a new version is available, you’ll be prompted to download and install the latest APK from this page.

- Current: **{{VERSION}}**
- SHA-256: `{{SHA256}}`
- Direct link: {{APK_URL}}

## Troubleshooting

- **“App not installed”**: If you previously installed a different build signed with a different key, uninstall it first, then install again.
- **Blocked download**: Some browsers warn on APKs. Choose “Download anyway” and ensure you’re downloading from `dumb.co`.
