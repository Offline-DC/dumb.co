## 📣 Marketing Intern

**Dumb & Co** is seeking a creative and unconventional **Marketing Intern** to gather, dream, make things happen, and join our team.

Do you live dumb? Are you IRL-first, low-tech curious, and maybe feel like people around you just don’t _get it_? If so — apply for our internship program.

Marketing offline is about friction; we use analog tools to bring guerrilla ideas to life. We want someone who’s not afraid of a challenge — better yet, someone who’s willing to challenge us.

### Responsibilities

- Plan, promote, and host Dumb (offline & phone-free) events
- Execute guerrilla marketing: flyering, wheat pasting, street art, and creative public activations
- Support brainstorming and execution of unconventional PR stunts
- Help document campaigns through writing, photography, or video
- Build relationships with aligned communities and cultural spaces

### Requirements

- Deep interest in culture, trends, and social movements (past and present)
- Background or strong interest in Art, PR, Event Planning, Communications, or Community Organizing
- Comfortable talking to strangers and being out in the world
- Creative, scrappy, and excited by unconventional ideas
