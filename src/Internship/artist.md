## 🎨 Artist-in-Residence

dumb.co is looking to host a seasonal **Artist-in-Residence**. We want artists, creatives, designers — you name it. We wanna host u if ur willing to dumb down with us.

We're all for analog, handmade, low-tech art, but that doesn't mean no tech at all. Whatever your medium(s), we'd love to take a look.

This residency is about exploring **offline life, slowness, presence, and human connection** through creative practice.
